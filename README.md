# Customer Feedback Analysis Using Flask and LSTM

## Project Overview

Customer Feedback Analysis is a web application built using Flask and HTML that performs sentiment analysis on user-provided feedback using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The application helps businesses gain insights from customer feedback to improve their products and services.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for submitting feedback.
- Sentiment analysis using LSTM for accurate classification.
- Display of sentiment (positive/negative) and probability.
- Visualization of sentiment using emotion images.
- Integration of frontend and backend using Flask API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-feedback-analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd customer-feedback-analysis`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`
5. Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. Enter your feedback in the provided input field.
2. Click the "Check Sentiment" button to analyze the sentiment.
3. The application will display the sentiment (positive/negative) and probability.
4. An emotion image will visually represent the sentiment.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: Backend web framework.
- HTML: Frontend user interface.
